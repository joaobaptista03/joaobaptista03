#### My name is Jo√£o Pedro Baptista, a third-year Software Engineering student at Universidade do Minho, Braga, Portugal. I'm finishing my Bachelor's and will soon start my Master's in the same field. 

#### Currently, I'm doing a summer internship at Checkmarx in Braga. 

#### My academic projects are in repositories starting with "UMinho", while my own projects are aimed at enhancing my programming skills.

#### Despite having front-end experience, my focus is more on backend development. Explore my programming projects showcased on this website.
