#### Currently Studying Computer Science and Engineering at Universidade do Minho!

#### I have worked in multiple projects, using languages like C, JS, C#, Java, Python, and Haskell. I've learned HTML, CSS, SQL, and MATLAB as well, but I am more used to Software Programming.

#### The repositories started with "UMinho" are projects developed in the course. All the others are Own Projects that I developed in order to enhance my programming skills.
