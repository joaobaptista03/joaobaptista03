**Currently Studying Computer Science and Engineering at Universidade do Minho!**

**I have worked in multiple projects, using languages like C, C#, Java, Python, and Haskell. I've learned HTML, CSS, JS (and Node), SQL, and MATLAB as well, but I am more used to Software Programming.**

**All the repositories started with "UMinho" are projects developed in the course.**
